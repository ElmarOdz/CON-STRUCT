  ## THE CHALLENGE
  
The construction industry is a critical component of the global economy, employing millions of people worldwide. The industry has been known to have unique challenges that require specialized skills, resources, and tools. However, many businesses and workers in the construction industry face difficulties in finding skilled workers, contractors, and business opportunities. To address these challenges, we propose the development of an app called CON-STRUCT, a business and employment-focused social media platform that works through websites and mobile apps

    Objective:
    
The primary objective of the CON-STRUCT app is to create a platform where businesses and skilled workers in the construction industry can connect and interact with each other. The app will allow businesses to post job openings, project updates, and search for skilled workers and contractors in various construction fields. On the other hand, skilled workers and contractors can use the platform to find job opportunities, build their professional network, and promote their services to potential clients.

    Key Features:
    
- User Registration and Login:
Users can create an account on the platform by registering with their email address and password. Once registered, they can log in to the platform to access its features.
- Profile Creation and Management:
Users can create and manage their profiles on the platform. They can add their personal information, work experience, and skills to their profile.
- Job Posting and Application:
Employers can post job opportunities on the platform, and job seekers can apply for those jobs through the platform.
Professional Networking: Users can connect with one another on the platform to build their professional networks. They can send and receive messages and connect with other users.
- Construction News feed:
Users can stay up-to-date with the latest construction news through the platform's newsfeed feature. They can filter the news by category and view the articles that interest them.
