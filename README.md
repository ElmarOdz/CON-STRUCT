  ## THE CHALLENGE
  
The construction industry is a critical component of the global economy, employing millions of people worldwide. The industry has been known to have unique challenges that require specialized skills, resources, and tools. However, many businesses and workers in the construction industry face difficulties in finding skilled workers, contractors, and business opportunities. To address these challenges, we propose the development of an app called CON-STRUCT, a business and employment-focused social media platform that works through websites and mobile apps

    Objective:
    
The primary objective of the CON-STRUCT app is to create a platform where businesses and skilled workers in the construction industry can connect and interact with each other. The app will allow businesses to post job openings, project updates, and search for skilled workers and contractors in various construction fields. On the other hand, skilled workers and contractors can use the platform to find job opportunities, build their professional network, and promote their services to potential clients.

    Key Features:
    
- User Registration and Login:
Users can create an account on the platform by registering with their email address and password. Once registered, they can log in to the platform to access its features.
